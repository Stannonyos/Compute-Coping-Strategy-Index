# Coping Strategy Index

CSI is a food and nutrition proxy indicator for access to food. To come up with the indicator, you ask a series of questions on what a household do if they do not have adequate food.
CSI measure frequency and severity of coping behaviours. To come up with the coping behaviours and severity score, you can do exploratory research before the main survey.

To calculate the index:

- Get the weighted score= frequency of use of a behaviour * score for the coping strategy
- Sum the weighted scores i.e. based on the strategies used

Now, CSI is an emergency response indicator that is monitored. If the index is lower than it was during the baseline/ initial study then the food security situtation is alarming.
A significant decline will need a quick response.

I have generated data on overall use of coping strategies in two counties i.e. A & B and made comparison on which of the two counties has the highest index- this is hypothetical and the data generated is random.
